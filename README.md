# spotify-clone
 
This Spotify clone is a static replica of the popular music streaming platform, built using only HTML and CSS. The project focuses on replicating Spotifyâ€™s sleek, modern interface with a clean and minimalist design. It includes a sidebar with essential navigation links like Home, Search, and Your Library, all styled with CSS to maintain a polished, user-friendly appearance. The top search bar allows users to search for music, though without functional capabilities, as this is a static project.

The main content area showcases sections such as Featured Playlists, Popular Albums, and Top Tracks, mimicking the layout of the Spotify app. Each section is neatly organized in rows and columns, with hover effects to enhance the user experience.

Fully responsive, the design adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This project demonstrates how HTML and CSS can be used to create a visually appealing static web design.
