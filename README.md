# spotify-clone
 This project is a static Spotify clone built using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the appâ€™s layout, including a sidebar with navigation links, a top search bar, and a main content area displaying playlists, albums, and tracks. The design is fully responsive, offering a clean and minimalistic interface similar to the original Spotify app.
